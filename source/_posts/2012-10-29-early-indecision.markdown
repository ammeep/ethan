> I suggested Wesleyan College to my sister, since I have a close friend who does nothing but talk about how much he loved his time there. We looked up Wesleyan in Naviance, which reported that my sister's ACTs were slightly lower than the school's average for admission, and many students from her school with similar GPAs had been rejected. I explained that it was just a calculation, that it didn't take into account the fact that she was a great writer, talented artist, varsity athlete, and soup kitchen volunteer. But she seemed overwhelmed and defeated by what she was being told by an ugly graph.

> I can keep telling her that everything will work out, that in hindsight, she'll realize that not getting into her first-choice school is not the end of the world. But the last thing a teenager wants is their distress to be treated with condescension. A teenager's pain is unique and singular, and yet it must be understood by everyone around her.

With so much information available online, it's very easy to get yourself worked up over statistics. I know that my GPA doesn't exactly match up with my top choice, but I'm still hopeful. We aren't just numbers&mdash;we have substance and can all contribute to whatever college we end up going to.
