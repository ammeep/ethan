Muse has announced that their track _Survival_ has been chosen as the [official song of the London 2012 Olympic Games](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18607319). They'll also being playing in the closing ceremonies of the Games.

I love Muse, and I'm glad to see them coming out with new material. Their new album _The 2nd Law_ [will be released in September](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/18344442).
