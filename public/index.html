	<p>The BBC has released a prequel for the 2012 <em>Doctor Who</em> Christmas Special, <em>The Great Detective</em>! It&#8217;s been a long few months since the first half of this season has ended, and I can&#8217;t wait to see how the new companion (Jenna-Louise Coleman) will be compared to the great Karen Gillan and Arthur Darville.</p>

	<blockquote><p>I suggested Wesleyan College to my sister, since I have a close friend who does nothing but talk about how much he loved his time there. We looked up Wesleyan in Naviance, which reported that my sister&#8217;s ACTs were slightly lower than the school&#8217;s average for admission, and many students from her school with similar GPAs had been rejected. I explained that it was just a calculation, that it didn&#8217;t take into account the fact that she was a great writer, talented artist, varsity athlete, and soup kitchen volunteer. But she seemed overwhelmed and defeated by what she was being told by an ugly graph.</p>

<p>I can keep telling her that everything will work out, that in hindsight, she&#8217;ll realize that not getting into her first-choice school is not the end of the world. But the last thing a teenager wants is their distress to be treated with condescension. A teenager&#8217;s pain is unique and singular, and yet it must be understood by everyone around her.</p></blockquote>

<p>With so much information available online, it&#8217;s very easy to get yourself worked up over statistics. I know that my GPA doesn&#8217;t exactly match up with my top choice, but I&#8217;m still hopeful. We aren&#8217;t just numbers&mdash;we have substance and can all contribute to whatever college we end up going to.</p>

	<p>For my senior year at high school, I decided to do a capstone project. Students are given a (relatively) large amount of freedom to do whatever they&#8217;d like with this project, whether it be academic, charitable, or innovative.</p>

<p>Besides AP Computer Science, there aren&#8217;t many courses that align with what I love doing. So, I see this as a great opportunity&mdash;I get to do something that I love doing, but get school credit for it. Since I&#8217;ve had the idea to do this project for years, having the ability to do it with the support of my school is wonderful.</p>

<p>In about eighth grade, we began using a product that aimed to help students manage their research project by generating citations and keeping track of notes. While easier than manually writing down <a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/">all of the information that goes with citations</a>, it still was frustrating to use. Every time a teacher said we would be using this product for a project, the class would groan in unison. But more importantly, there was quite a steep learning curve&mdash;this makes it difficult to teach younger students.</p>

<p>Plus, the featureset that this product has was very restrained&mdash;in this niche, there is a lot of room for innovation. Keeping track of a research project and its related information is something that quite a few people have a use for, including students, teachers, and researchers, so making it easier is something that no one has really taken a big step in.</p>

<br />


<p>Thus, the idea for Noted was born.</p>

<br />


<p>Noted is more than a research management tool, but a collaboration, discovery, and publishing tool as well. My aim is to make keeping track of your research not a burden, but something that feels natural and easy. Working with others should be as simple as finding a project you&#8217;re interested in and contributing. And finally, making the results of your research available to the public can be as simple as clicking a button.</p>

<p>This project is still in its infancy. I&#8217;ve never created a business before&mdash;that will be difficult. There is an entire course at my school that does exactly that (e-commerce), so learning it all by myself and in half the time will be a challenge.</p>

<p>I look forward to working on this project, as it is something I&#8217;m genuinely interested in. I have one foot in academics, and another in the career of my choice. Combining the two will be a great experience not only for me, but hopefully for the students I help with the results.</p>

<br />


<p>Keep an eye out here or on <a href="http://twitter.com/ethnt">my Twitter</a> for news related to Noted. If you&#8217;re interested, you can see <a href="http://dribbble.com/ethan/tags/noted">Dribbble</a> to see the look of the site progressing or <a href="http://github.com/noted/noted">GitHub</a> to see how the code is coming along. It&#8217;ll certainly be a lot of work, but a challenge I look forward to.</p>

	<p>Just yesterday Muse released their new album, <em>The 2nd Law</em>. <em>Save Me</em> is the first Muse track to have been written and feature vocals from bassist Chris Wolstenholme.</p>

<blockquote><p>[The song is about] having the family, the wife and the kids who, despite all the crap that I&#8217;ve put them through, at the end of it you realise they&#8217;re still there and they&#8217;re the ones who pulled you through.</p></blockquote>
