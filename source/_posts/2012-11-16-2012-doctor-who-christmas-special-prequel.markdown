The BBC has released a prequel for the 2012 _Doctor Who_ Christmas Special, _The Great Detective_! It's been a long few months since the first half of this season has ended, and I can't wait to see how the new companion (Jenna-Louise Coleman) will be compared to the great Karen Gillan and Arthur Darville.
