I returned from a fantastic ten-day trip to Paris and Caen, France on Wednesday. I had a great time seeing monuments like the Tour Eiffel, Arc de Triomphe, Musée du Louvre, Musée d'Orsay, Notre Dame, Sacre Coeur, Mont Saint-Michel, and others. However, it was the people I traveled with that made it not only a good trip, but an awesome one.
