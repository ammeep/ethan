[TÃ¡til Design de Ideias](http://www.abstratil.com.br/) in collaboration with the London-based font foundry [Dalton Maag](http://daltonmaag.com) created the Rio 2016 Olympic logo. When you first look at it, it's simply three people holding hands. But if you understand the history, culture, and even georgraphy of Rio, it becomes far more meaningful.
