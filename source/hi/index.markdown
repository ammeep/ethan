I'm a Farmington, Connecticut-based sixteen-year-old student and web developer at [Fanzter](http://fanzter.com). I've been making websites since I was nine-years-old, and I'm now a professional web developer. Want to hire me? Talk to me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/ethnt) or use good old-fashioned [electronic mail](mailto:ethan.turkeltaub@gmail.com).
